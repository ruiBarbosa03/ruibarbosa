Personal presentation webpage. 

The goal is to learn a bit more about webdev and design and have something other than linkedin to point to recruiters. Also want to be able to have all the info about projects I'm making and other volunteering activities in one place where I can control pretty much anything. 

Might also start a random themed blog.

INTENT:
-> Will use HTML, CSS & PHP to get things running.
-> Try out bootstrapping for some pazaz - reactive stuff, make it look good and clean
-> Firebase DB for blog content
-> Looking for more stuff to add :)
