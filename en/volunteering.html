			<h1> Volunteering </h1>
			<h2> ESN Porto </h2>
			<p> In September 2015 I started my Erasmus+ Studies mobility period in Gent, Belgium. These were the 5 months that most shifted my views of life.
				I was in daily contact with people from all over the world, with different life experiences and different ways of thinking.
				I grew as a person and as a citizen of the world. Back in my hometown, in Porto, I wanted to keep this multicultural spirit alive, so I joined the Erasmus Student Network Porto.</p>

			<p> ESN Porto is a no-profit, student run, volunteering association, whose goal is to receive the thousands of international students that every year choose Porto as their mobility destination. 
				We organize several cultural activities, trips all over the country and parties for more than 3000 thousand people a year.
				However, it's not just fun and games. With ESN Porto I also organized and took part in several social activities: support to the homeless, support to street animals, visits to a day care center ...</p>
			
			<p>	This is an association, that despite being student run, is very well structured, where everyone knows its role. Ever since I became full member, I've already took several positions in the structure of ESN Porto: </p>
