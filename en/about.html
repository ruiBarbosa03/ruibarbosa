			<h1> About me </h1>
		</div>
		<p> Hi, I'm Rui. I'm 23 and just finished my Master's Degree in Electrical and Computers Engineering in FEUP (Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto) with a final grade of 17 out of 20.
			My Master's thesis topic was to build a <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/pub_geral.pub_view?pi_pub_base_id=208281">"System to monitor water consumption using Sigfox technology</a>, with which I was awarded a grade of 18 out of 20. </p>
		
		<p>	During my period in university, the areas that interested me the most were Electronics, Control and Robotics.
			In my last year I worked part-time as an assistant professor in the course of Electronics I, taught to sophomores. </p>
		
		<p>	In my forth year I did Erasmus in Gent, Belgium, and that woke in me a great apreciation for the history and culture of other people than my own.
			Ever since I volunteer at ESN Porto, my main hobbie.</p>
		
		<h2> Interests </h2>
		<p> As said, one of my biggest passions is studying the history and culture, not only of Portugal, but of all the peoples.
			Volunteering in ESN is a great catalyst of this passion, as well as the trips that I've been making since my Erasmus.</p>
			
		<p> When I visit a country I like to absorb its culture and history, learn its language and above all, have the local experience.
			Up until now I kept within the confines of Europe, but trips to further destinations are coming soon.</p>

		<p> With so many travels, some things stay with you. One of them are the languages I've learnt. Ever since my childhood I'm interested in learning languages other than my mother tongue.
			Some (english and french) I learnt in school. Others (italian) on my own, just because it sounded nice. Dutch, however, I learnt while on Erasmus in the Flemish part of Belgium, and Spanish through daily contact in my volunteering work.
			Here's a map summing up my skills in all the languages I am able to say something in.</p>

		<h2> Sports </h2>
		<p> For 5 year I practiced handball in my middle and high school teams. In some of the seasons I was chosen as team captain. My apreciation for sports is something that never went away.
			Still today I watch handball, as well as basketball, tennis and roller hockey (sport like field hockey except is played in a smaller field and with roller skates, Portugal and Spain dominate it).
			Contact with nature is also something that drives me. Recently I took up surfing classes.</p>

		<h2> Reading </h2>
		<p> Reading and debate are also activities that I enjoy and do often.</p>
		<p> 	My favourite reading subjects are history and philosophy, fantasy novels, terror and some american classics.
			My favourite authors are George R.R. Martin, Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck and Stephen King. </p>
